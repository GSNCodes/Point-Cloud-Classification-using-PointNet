# Point-Cloud-Classification-using-PointNet
Classifying point clouds of different objects using PointNet

We will be focussing on classifying point clouds as belonging to one of several different object classes.

## Architecture

Shown below is the architecure proposed by the authors of the PointNet paper. This implementation will take up the classification network alone.
